## Updates (MM/DD/YYYY)

12/22/2024 WD:

> I've done a fair amount setup on the project at this point, setting up the frontend, setting up the backend, setting up the frontend again, and I've also written some of the functionality for the backend, including some set up with the API we're using. Justin hasn't really done anything... and I'm tempted to just do the entire frontend too! Justin, if you are reading this, can you do something on the frontend, or like, work on the doc.
